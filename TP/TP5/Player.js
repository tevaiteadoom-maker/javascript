                    The else if condition leading to our attack animation needs at least one of currentAttackSpriteStep and attackSpriteIndex to be > 0
                    When we reach the if we are in right now, currentAttackSpriteStep is always equal to 0
                    When we'll get out of it, attackSpriteIndex will be set to 0 too
                    This will signify that the animation is over, and the else if condition leading to our attack animation should not trigger anymore.
                    This mecanism is implemented to avoid playing several attacking animations in a row (graphically incoherent with our attack cooldown).
                    The only exception would be for the server to maintain isAttacking at true even after the end of the animation.
                    This is not supposed to happen as i programmed the server to maintain isAttacking at true for a very short amount of time.
